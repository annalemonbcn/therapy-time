## 📋 Introduction

This project is a search engine for users and their corresponding repositories that are hosted on GitHub.
Its operation is very simple: enter a username in the search bar and explore the different repositories. You can filter them by programming language or even by name!

**Responsive design**

## 💡 Features

This project has some interesting features that I want to highlight:

#### Fetch data: GraphQL API

- All the info related to the users is taken from the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql">GitHub GraphQL API</a>.
- This info is obtained through _fetch API_ and _promises_ methods
- It was necessary to consult the documentation to find the suitable methods for getting the data. For more information, follow this link:
  https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql

### Search engine

- The search engine **only works when the Search button is clicked**. This is to avoid overloading the app. With a real-time search engine, many unnecessary requests would be executed. 
- Clicking the Search button will trigger the fetching of the users information and their repositories will be immediately rendered
- The search engine can be accessed by pressing the **`/`** key. Try it!
- To search for a user, you can either **press the Search button** or **hit the enter key**.
